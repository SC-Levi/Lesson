How to put down your phone
First how much time you pay on your phone per day?
How much it takes in your fun time?

Maybe when you feel it boring you will hand up your phone,and begin your internet surfing.
For instance, if the man who give a speech is your friend,you may feel it interesting and hand up your phone open the camera and record it.
However, While a stranger is giving a speech like me, of course,if you feel bored, you are holding your phone and continue your internet surfing.
we a re free to choose how to spend our time ,and one of the rule is We tend to pay attention to somnething more interesting.
It's because we like to make our brain more comfortable feel better.

It's unavailable that we should spend some time to reply the message you get, learning what happened lately,and internet surfing.
However, if we spend 25% your day in putting down on it, while it can take 1 hour per day to solve, it is hard to say you cherish the time.
I don't want to persuade you to cherish the time, it's teacher and parents' work,
I just want to state that it's like a daydreaming and the work is controled over.
Take break ,think what you want, the optional media or streaming video?
How about remove the optional absent anything absolutely you don't need for somedays 
Go without it for thirty days .Afterwards, ask yourself, what you really miss 
and more importantly what you don't miss during the last month
